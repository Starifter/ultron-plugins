"""Ollama - models on this machine through a local Ollama, or in Ollama's cloud.

Ollama speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions dialect at `/v1`, so both providers here
are the SDK's OpenAI-compatible base (`plugin-sdk.md` §6.7) with Ollama's own
parts declared: `reasoning_effort` as Ollama maps it onto a model's thinking,
the native `/api/tags`, `/api/show` and `/api/ps` for what `/v1/models` does not
say, and - for a local server - the context it actually loaded a model with.

Two providers, one plugin. `ollama` is the server on this machine (or your
network): no key, a server address, every model priced at zero. `ollama-cloud`
is ollama.com directly, with `OLLAMA_API_KEY`. They are two names rather than
one with a mode because `local` is a declaration about a provider, and one that
changed with a setting would be a manifest that lies half the time.

**The context a local request gets is the server's, not the model's.** Ollama
loads a model with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, or 4k/32k/256k by the GPU's memory,
and its OpenAI endpoint has no way to ask for more. A prompt longer than that is
cut from the front, silently. So `ollama` reads the loaded size from `/api/ps`,
tells the session that size when it can, loads the model before the first
request so the size is known, and refuses a request that would not fit - with
how to raise it - rather than let Ollama cut it.

Requires the `openai` package (`pip install openai`, or `pip install "ultron[openai]"`).
