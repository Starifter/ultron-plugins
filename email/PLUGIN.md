# email

Your mail for Ultron, over plain IMAP and SMTP, so it works with any provider: Fastmail,
iCloud, Gmail, your own server - anything that takes an app password over IMAP (see
[Gmail](#gmail)). One tool, `email`,
reads, searches, drafts, sends and files mail across as many accounts as you configure.
One background service watches the folders you choose and tells the agent when new mail
lands.

```
/plugins install email
```

Installed from the official marketplace, its two libraries (`aioimaplib`, `aiosmtplib`) are
installed with it, into a folder of its own under `~/.ultron/plugin-libs/` - never into the
environment Ultron runs in. Installed from anywhere else, run
`uv pip install aioimaplib aiosmtplib` in Ultron's environment yourself.

## Mail is information, never instructions

Anyone can put words in front of your agent for the price of your address, so this
plugin treats mail the way `web_fetch` treats a web page:

- **Everything a sender wrote is enveloped.** Headers, body, attachment names and their
  contents reach the model inside an untrusted envelope, from every sender, your own
  address included. A `From:` line is something anybody can write.
- **No email is ever a prompt.** Mail never becomes a message to the agent, a turn, or a
  rule. You cannot email your agent instructions, and neither can anyone else.
- **New mail is a notification.** The wake the agent gets says only the account, the
  folder, how many arrived and their numbers, then your own `on_new` instruction. The
  agent reads the mail through the tool, enveloped.
- **No person, no send.** A turn that new mail started, a cron job or the heartbeat can
  read, search, draft and file, and cannot send, reply or forward. Sending happens only
  in a turn you started.
- **Nothing is deleted.** `trash` moves mail to your Trash folder; the plugin never
  expunges.

The tool is the owner's alone: it is not offered in a group chat, a thread, a webhook
session or a stranger's DM. A cron job does have it, so a job can summarise or file your mail
on a schedule - and, as above, never send.

## Setup

The easiest way is the web UI: open **Plugins**, then **email**, then **Settings**. Add an
account by name, fill in its fields and its app password, and save. The password goes to
`~/.ultron/.env` and never to config. The steps below do the same by hand.

1. Make an app password at your provider. Most refuse a normal password over IMAP; iCloud
   and Fastmail both have one. For Gmail, see the next section.
2. Add the account in `~/.ultron/config.json`:

   ```json
   { "plugins_settings": { "email": {
       "accounts": {
         "personal": {
           "address": "me@fastmail.com",
           "imap_host": "imap.fastmail.com",
           "smtp_host": "smtp.fastmail.com",
           "watch": ["INBOX"]
         }
       },
       "on_new": "Summarise new mail and tell me if anything needs me today."
   } } }
   ```

3. Store the password with the `secret` tool (ask the agent to "store my email password"),
   or put it in `~/.ultron/.env` yourself:

   ```
   ULTRON_EMAIL_PASSWORD_PERSONAL=<the app password>
   ```

4. Start a new session. `email accounts` lists what the plugin can use.

| Account key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `address` | required | The address mail is sent from. |
| `name` | `""` | The display name on sent mail. |
| `username` | `address` | The login, when it differs from the address. |
| `imap_host`, `imap_port` | required, `993` | IMAP over TLS. |
| `smtp_host`, `smtp_port` | required, `465` | `465` is TLS, `587` is STARTTLS. There is no plaintext mode. |
| `watch` | `[]` | Folders whose new mail wakes the agent. Empty watches nothing. |
| `sent_folder` | `auto` | Where a sent copy is filed. `auto` finds your Sent folder, and files nothing for Gmail and Outlook, which keep their own copy. `""` never files one. |
| `drafts_folder`, `trash_folder`, `archive_folder` | `auto` | Found by the server's folder roles, else by name. |
| `provider` | `""` | `gmail`: fills in the hosts and ports. The account still signs in with an app password. |

## Gmail

Set `provider: gmail` and the plugin fills in Gmail's servers; the account signs in with an
app password like any other. Ultron has no Google sign-in.

```json
{ "plugins_settings": { "email": {
    "accounts": {
      "personal": { "provider": "gmail", "address": "me@gmail.com", "watch": ["INBOX"] }
    }
} } }
```

Turn on 2-Step Verification for your Google account, make an app password at
<https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>, and store it as
`ULTRON_EMAIL_PASSWORD_PERSONAL`. IMAP must be on in Gmail's settings.

Outlook is not supported: Microsoft has turned off passwords over IMAP and SMTP for
Outlook.com and most Microsoft 365 mailboxes, and Ultron has no Microsoft sign-in.

## What the agent can do

| Action | Does | Needs your OK |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts`, `folders`, `search`, `read`, `thread`, `attachment` | Read | no |
| `draft` | Save a draft to Drafts | no |
| `send`, `reply`, `forward` | Send mail. Only in a turn you started. | as your permission mode says |
| `mark`, `move`, `archive`, `trash` | File mail | as your permission mode says |

Sends and changes are decided by your permission mode: `yolo` runs them, `ask` shows a card
naming the account, every recipient and the subject, `auto` hands them to the reviewer.
Attachments are read through Ultron's media readers, so a PDF in mail is read the way a
PDF in chat is. Nothing is saved to your workspace.

## New mail

With `on_new` set and a `watch` list, the plugin keeps a connection to each watched folder,
using IMAP IDLE where the server has it and checking every `poll_seconds` where it does not.
New unread mail is gathered for `debounce_seconds`, then the agent's main session gets one
turn:

```
[woken by plugin email]
New mail: personal INBOX 2 (uids 902, 903, uidvalidity 1714).
The person asked: Summarise new mail and tell me if anything needs me today.
```

Turning it on announces nothing old: the first start records where your mailbox is. Mail
that arrived while Ultron was off is one wake when it comes back. A wake the agent could
not take (busy for five minutes) keeps its mail for the next one. `plugins_no_wake: ["email"]`
stops the wakes without uninstalling anything.

There are no rules on what a message says. Sorting by sender or subject is a stranger
choosing what your agent does. Use your mail server's filters to sort mail into a folder,
and watch that folder.

The last message number seen per folder is kept in `<workspace>/.ultron/email.json`:
numbers and folder names, never mail.
