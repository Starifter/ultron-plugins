"""DeepSeek provider - DeepSeek's own models, at DeepSeek.

DeepSeek speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions at `https://api.deepseek.com`, so this is
the SDK's OpenAI-compatible base with DeepSeek's own parts declared on it
(`plugin-sdk.md` §6.7): thinking switched by `thinking.type` with an effort beside
it, every earlier turn's `reasoning_content` sent back (DeepSeek refuses a request
with tools that leaves it out), and a cache DeepSeek reports in its own words.

Requires the `openai` package (`pip install openai`) and Ultron's SDK 1.25, for
`replay_reasoning_as`.
