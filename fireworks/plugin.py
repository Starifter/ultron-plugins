"""Fireworks AI provider - open models, hosted at Fireworks.

Fireworks speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions at `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`,
so this is the SDK's OpenAI-compatible base with Fireworks' own parts declared on it
(`plugin-sdk.md` §6.7): every earlier turn's `reasoning_content` sent back, since a
model loses its thinking across a tool loop without it, and a request that would not
fit refused rather than shortened.

Requires the `openai` package (`pip install openai`) and Ultron's SDK 1.25, for
`replay_reasoning_as`.
