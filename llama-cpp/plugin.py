"""llama.cpp provider - a `llama-server` on this machine, no key, no bill.

`llama-server` (the HTTP server in ggml-org/llama.cpp) speaks OpenAI's Chat
Completions dialect at `/v1`, so this is the SDK's OpenAI-compatible base
(`plugin-sdk.md` §6.7) pointed at wherever the server listens. What is
llama.cpp's alone is here: a server that needs no credential, a model the server
already chose, `GET /props` for the context the server was started with and what
it can see, `reasoning_effort` and `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` for the
thinking switch a template honours, and a price of zero because the machine is
yours.

Two ways to run. Point `base_url` at a server you started (`llama-server -m
model.gguf`, with `--mmproj` for pictures and `--api-key` if it is not on
loopback), or name a model in `server_model` and the plugin starts `llama-server`
for you - the binary you installed, found on `PATH` or named in `server_binary`,
on a scrubbed environment, on loopback, with `-hf` doing the download - and
keeps it up for as long as this process runs. Looking for the program is the
plugin's, as `ready()` is for any plugin; the core never does it, and nothing
here fetches an executable.

Requires the `openai` package (`pip install openai`, or `pip install "ultron[openai]"`).
