"""What this marketplace promises about every entry, checked.

Runs on every change in CI and by hand before a pull request. It reads each
top-level directory the way Ultron's own discovery does - the manifest is
parsed and nothing is imported - so passing here means `/plugins market
refresh` will list the entry and `/plugins install` will take it. It does not
run the plugin: what a plugin does once consented to is the reader's call, and
this script says nothing about it.

Usage: python scripts/validate.py [root]
