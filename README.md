# Ultron plugins

The official plugin marketplace for [Ultron](https://github.com/Starifter/ultron).
Every top-level directory here is one plugin: a `PLUGIN.md` manifest and a `plugin.py`
beside it, written against `ultron.sdk` and nothing else - exactly what the plugins
Ultron itself ships are made of.

Every Ultron install has this marketplace connected under the name `official`. Nothing is
fetched until you ask:

```
/plugins market refresh official      fetch or update the copy on this machine
/plugins                              Discover tab: what it offers
/plugins install dice                 copy one into ~/.ultron/plugins/ and enable it
```

Installing is two things said out loud - a copy into `~/.ultron/plugins/<name>/`, then a
line in `plugins_enabled` - and the plugin loads on the next session. A marketplace is
where a plugin comes from and never where one runs from: forgetting this marketplace
(`/plugins market remove official`) leaves every plugin installed from it in place.

## What is here

| plugin | what it adds |
|---|---|
| `openrouter` | A model provider: one `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, every model OpenRouter routes to, with a live catalog of what each costs. |
| `llama-cpp` | A model provider for a `llama-server` on this machine: GGUF models, no key, no bill, with an embedder for memory search. |
| `ollama` | Two model providers: `ollama` for a local Ollama (no key, no bill, context checked against what Ollama loaded) and `ollama-cloud` for ollama.com with `OLLAMA_API_KEY`, plus an embedder. |
| `lmstudio` | A model provider for LM Studio on this machine: loads the model at the context you choose, no key, no bill, with an embedder. |
| `groq` | A model provider for Groq (`GROQ_API_KEY`): open models served fast, with `/think` per model family. |
| `deepseek` | A model provider for DeepSeek (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`), its thinking carried through tool loops the way DeepSeek requires. Needs SDK 1.25. |
| `xai` | A model provider for xAI's Grok (`XAI_API_KEY`), priced from xAI's own listing, long-context rate included. |
| `together` | A model provider for Together AI (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`): its hosted open models, priced from its listing. |
| `fireworks` | A model provider for Fireworks AI (`FIREWORKS_API_KEY`): its hosted open models, reasoning carried through tool loops. Needs SDK 1.25. |
| `dice` | A `roll_dice` tool - the example a new plugin is copied from. |

## What "official" means

Only that Ultron knows this repository's address. A plugin here goes through the same
refresh, the same copy and the same consent line as one from any other marketplace, and
nothing is allowed or refused because it came from here. What the marketplace promises is
the check in [`scripts/validate.py`](scripts/validate.py), run before every merge: each entry
has a manifest that parses, a name that matches its directory, a version, an SDK range that
the current SDK satisfies, and no `autoload` - which Ultron refuses from anything it did
not ship, so a plugin here that said it would be a plugin lying about itself.

CI runs the same check, but cannot yet: it installs Ultron from its repository, which is
private for now, so the `validate` job fails before it reaches a plugin. Until that changes,
the check is run against a local Ultron checkout, and a red `validate` says nothing about
the change it is on.

## Pointing an install elsewhere

`plugin_marketplace_official` in `config.json` is the address. A path to a checkout of this
repository reads it in place, which is how it is developed; `""` disconnects it.

```json
{ "plugin_marketplace_official": "~/dev/ultron-plugins" }
```

## Adding a plugin

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: copy `dice/`, rename
everything, make `scripts/validate.py` pass, open a pull request.
