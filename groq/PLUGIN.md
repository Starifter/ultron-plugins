# groq

Open models - GPT-OSS, Qwen, Llama - on [Groq](https://groq.com)'s hardware, which is
built to answer fast.

```
/plugins install groq
ultron auth add groq                  # a key from console.groq.com, or GROQ_API_KEY in ~/.ultron/.env
```

then `provider: groq` and a `model` in `config.json`, or `--provider groq --model
openai/gpt-oss-120b`. **There is no default model**: Groq's line-up changes month to
month, and `ultron models list groq` shows what it serves today.

## The catalog is live

The manifest lists no models. `/model list --refresh` (or `ultron models refresh groq`)
asks Groq's `GET /models`, which says each model's window and reply ceiling; a model Groq
marks inactive is not offered. Prices come from the catalog Ultron publishes, hydrated
from [models.dev](https://models.dev), so `/status` knows what a turn cost - and says
*unknown*, never zero, for a model it has no price for.

## Thinking

`/think` depends on the model, because Groq's control does:

| Model | `/think` | Sent as |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-OSS (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `-20b`) | `low`, `medium`, `high` - no `off`, it always reasons | `reasoning_effort` |
| Qwen 3 (`qwen/qwen3...`) | `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high` | `reasoning_effort` (`none` is off), `reasoning_format: parsed` |
| Llama and the rest | none | nothing |

The reasoning comes back in Groq's `reasoning` field and is shown as thinking, never as
part of the reply.

## What reaches Groq

The conversation, the tool definitions, pictures for a model that takes them, and your
key. Nothing else: no Ultron setting, no file you did not attach.

## Not tested live

This plugin is built from Groq's API documentation and tested against a fake client. It
has not been run against the real API - if something Groq says is not handled, the error
is shown as Groq worded it.
