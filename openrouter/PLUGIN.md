# openrouter

One key, every model OpenRouter routes to: Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama
and the rest, by the ids OpenRouter lists them under - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`,
`openai/gpt-5.5`, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`.

```
/plugins install openrouter
ultron auth login openrouter          # a browser sign-in that mints a key, or
ultron auth add openrouter            # a key you made, or OPENROUTER_API_KEY in ~/.ultron/.env
```

then `provider: openrouter` and a `model` in `config.json`, or `--provider openrouter
--model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`. **There is no default model.** OpenRouter lists four
hundred, and naming one here would be this plugin choosing for you.

OpenRouter speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions dialect, so this rides the `openai` package
with the base URL moved - `pip install openai` if `/plugins openrouter` says it is
missing. The key is a `openrouter` auth profile like any provider's, rotated by failover
like any provider's, and never a setting.

## The catalog is live

The manifest lists no models, on purpose. `catalog: live` means `/model list --refresh`
(or `ultron models refresh openrouter`) asks `GET /models` and keeps what a listing may
say about each id: the context window, the reply ceiling, the price per million with
OpenRouter's long-prompt surcharge as a second tier, what the model takes (image, audio,
document, video) and when it appeared. A `:free` variant is priced at zero because it
is; a price OpenRouter will not quote is *unknown*, never zero. So `/status` knows what a
turn cost, and `/model show` says which listing said so and how old it is.

## Thinking

`/think off|low|medium|high|max` is one menu for every model, because OpenRouter's
`reasoning` parameter is one parameter: it becomes a budget on Claude, an effort on GPT,
and nothing on a model that does not reason - a parameter the upstream does not take is
dropped on the way through, never refused. That means the menu is OpenRouter's rather
than the model's. A model whose reasoning cannot be switched off refuses `off` once,
and the plugin stops offering it for the rest of the session. Where you know a model's
real menu, `model_catalog` in `config.json` is the place to say so and it wins over
this plugin's word.

What a model reasons is shown as it streams and kept as `reasoning_details` on the turn,
replayed unmodified on the next request - which is what a vendor whose thinking is
signed (Claude, with tools) requires before it will continue.

## Caching

A `cache_control` breakpoint goes on the system prompt's stable prefix and on the last
three turn-ends for `anthropic/*` models (`cache_ttl: 5m|1h|none` in config, as the shipped
Anthropic plugin sends them) and for `google/*`. Every other upstream caches on its own terms, and
is sent no breakpoint - and `cache_ttl_seconds` is zero for it, so the compaction gate has
nothing to wait on.

## Settings

Under `plugins_settings.openrouter`:

```jsonc
{
  "provider_order": ["anthropic", "google-vertex"],  // upstreams to try, in order
  "allow_fallbacks": false,                          // and nothing else
  "data_collection": "deny",                         // only upstreams that keep nothing
  "app_title": "my agent"                            // OpenRouter's X-Title attribution
}
```

`provider_order`, `allow_fallbacks` and `data_collection` are OpenRouter's `provider`
routing block, sent with every request. Nothing here is a credential; the key is the
profile's.

## Signing in with a browser

`ultron auth login openrouter` opens `openrouter.ai/auth`, catches the redirect on a
one-shot listener at `127.0.0.1` (or takes the landed URL pasted back when it cannot),
and exchanges the code for a key OpenRouter mints for this install - stored as the
`openrouter:oauth` profile, a key like any other, and never shown. It is not OAuth as
Ultron's `OAuthClient` describes it - no client id, a `callback_url` rather than a redirect
URI, an exchange that answers a key - so the plugin runs the flow itself (`oauth.md` §5.4)
and `/auth` says `plugin-run flow`. OpenRouter has no `state` of its own, but echoes
`callback_url` verbatim, so the flow's `state` rides inside it and is checked, in constant
time, on the redirect and on a pasted URL alike; a request that does not carry it is
answered 400 and ignored, and the listener keeps waiting for the right one. The key does not expire; there is nothing to refresh.
Revoke it at openrouter.ai/settings/keys.

## What is not here

No embedder and no fast mode: OpenRouter sells neither. A `Sampling` is
forwarded whole - OpenRouter drops what the upstream does not take.
