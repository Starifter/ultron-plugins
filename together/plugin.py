"""Together AI provider - open models, hosted at Together.

Together speaks OpenAI's Chat Completions at `https://api.together.ai/v1`, so this is
the SDK's OpenAI-compatible base with Together's own parts declared on it
(`plugin-sdk.md` §6.7): a request that would not fit is refused rather than cut, a
listing that is a bare array with a price on each row, and a cache figure reported
in either of two places.

Requires the `openai` package (`pip install openai`).
